# fnwispr

> Speech-to-text anywhere on Windows with a hotkey

fnwispr is a Windows speech-to-text tool that lets you dictate text in any application using a simple hotkey. Press and hold Ctrl+Win (configurable), speak, release, and your words appear as text - powered by OpenAI's Whisper running locally on your machine.

## Features

- **Universal Text Input**: Works in any Windows application that accepts text
- **Simple Hotkey**: Press and hold to record, release to transcribe
- **System Tray Integration**: Runs silently in the system tray with easy access menu
- **GUI Settings**: Graphical interface for all configuration options
- **Quick Model Selection**: Change Whisper model size directly from tray menu
- **Quick Microphone Selection**: Switch microphone devices from tray menu without opening settings
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally on your machine
- **High Accuracy**: Powered by OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition
- **Multi-Language**: Supports 99+ languages with automatic detection
- **Configurable**: Choose your hotkey, model size, language, and microphone via GUI
- **No Internet Required**: Works completely offline once models are downloaded
- **Windows Integration**: Auto-start at login, graceful error alerts for audio issues

## Architecture

fnwispr is a unified application that runs entirely on your Windows machine:
- **Hotkey Detection**: Uses `pynput` to detect global keyboard shortcuts
- **Audio Recording**: Captures audio from your microphone using `sounddevice`
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper model loaded locally
- **Text Insertion**: Simulates keyboard input with `pyautogui`
- **No External Services**: Everything runs on your machine

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A working microphone

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fnwispr.git
   cd fnwispr
   ```

2. **Initialize the development environment**
   ```powershell
   .\init.ps1
   ```

   This creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies. First run may take a few minutes to download the Whisper model.

3. **Create configuration file** (optional)
   ```bash
   copy client/config.example.json client/config.json
   ```

   Edit `client/config.json` if you want to change the hotkey or other settings.

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python client/main.py
   ```

   Or in VS Code: Press `F5` to debug

### Usage

#### First Run
When you run fnwispr for the first time, a settings window automatically opens. Configure your preferences:
- **Recording**: Set your hotkey, select microphone, choose language
- **Model**: Select Whisper model size (base recommended for most users)
- **General**: Enable/disable auto-start at login, set close behavior

#### Daily Usage
1. Start the application - it minimizes to the system tray
2. Look for the fnwispr icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner)
3. **To use the hotkey**:
   - Open any application where you want to type (e.g., Notepad, Word, browser)
   - Click to place your cursor where you want text inserted
   - Press and hold **Ctrl+Win** (or your configured hotkey)
   - Speak clearly into your microphone
   - Release the hotkey when done speaking
   - Wait a moment for transcription (depends on model size)
   - Your spoken words appear as text at the cursor

#### Tray Menu
Right-click the fnwispr icon in the system tray for quick access:
- **Settings...** - Open full settings window (or double-click icon)
- **Model >** - Change Whisper model size without opening settings
- **Microphone >** - Switch microphone device without opening settings
- **Exit** - Quit the application

#### Troubleshooting
- **Microphone not working?** Right-click tray icon → Microphone > and select a different device, or open Settings and click "Test Microphone"
- **Wrong model selected?** Right-click tray icon → Model > and pick a different size
- **Close to tray, quit, or ask?** Edit in Settings → General tab

**Press ESC to exit the application (only while keyboard listener is active)**

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through the GUI (recommended) or by editing `~/.fnwispr/config.json`:

```json
{
  "hotkey": "ctrl+win",
  "model": "base",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "microphone_device": null,
  "language": null,
  "auto_start": false,
  "close_behavior": "ask"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default | Options |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `hotkey` | Key combination to activate recording | `"ctrl+win"` | `"ctrl+alt"`, `"ctrl+win"`, `"ctrl_l+win"`, etc. |
| `model` | Whisper model size | `"base"` | `"tiny"`, `"base"`, `"small"`, `"medium"`, `"large"` |
| `sample_rate` | Audio sample rate | `16000` | `16000` recommended |
| `microphone_device` | Microphone to use | `null` (default) | `null` for default, or device index number |
| `language` | Force specific language | `null` (auto-detect) | `"en"`, `"es"`, `"fr"`, `"de"`, etc. |
| `auto_start` | Start fnwispr at Windows login | `false` | `true` or `false` |
| `close_behavior` | Action when closing settings window | `"ask"` | `"ask"`, `"minimize"` (to tray), `"quit"` |

### Configuration File Location
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\.fnwispr\config.json`
- Configuration is automatically created on first run
- If you have an old `client/config.json`, it's automatically migrated to the new location

### Hotkey Configuration

The `hotkey` option supports flexible key combinations:

**Modifier keys (both left and right work):**
- `ctrl` - Either left or right Ctrl
- `alt` - Either left or right Alt
- `shift` - Either left or right Shift
- `win` or `cmd` - Windows/Command key

**Specific variants (if you want only left or right):**
- `ctrl_l`, `ctrl_r` - Left or right Ctrl specifically
- `alt_l`, `alt_r` - Left or right Alt specifically
- `shift_l`, `shift_r` - Left or right Shift specifically

**Examples:**
- `"ctrl+win"` - Either Ctrl + either Windows key (recommended)
- `"ctrl+alt"` - Either Ctrl + either Alt
- `"ctrl_l+win"` - Only left Ctrl + either Windows key
- `"alt_r+shift"` - Only right Alt + either Shift
- `"ctrl+shift+a"` - Either Ctrl + either Shift + 'a' key

### Whisper Model Selection

Choose the model that best fits your needs:

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | VRAM | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|----------|------|----------|
| `tiny` | 39M | Fastest | Good | ~1GB | Quick testing, low-end systems |
| `base` | 74M | Fast | Better | ~1GB | **Recommended for most users** |
| `small` | 244M | Medium | Great | ~2GB | Better accuracy needed |
| `medium` | 769M | Slow | Excellent | ~5GB | High accuracy required |
| `large` | 1550M | Slowest | Best | ~10GB | Maximum accuracy |

To change the model, update the `model` field in `config.json` and restart the client.

## Finding Your Microphone Device

To list available audio devices:

```python
import sounddevice as sd
print(sd.query_devices())
```

Look for your microphone in the output and note its device ID number. Add it to `config.json`:

```json
{
  "microphone_device": 1
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No audio being recorded

**Problem**: Transcription returns empty or no text appears

**Solutions**:
1. Check your microphone is connected and working
2. Verify microphone isn't muted in Windows settings
3. Try specifying `microphone_device` explicitly in config (see above)
4. Check client logs in `fnwispr_client.log`

### Slow transcription

**Problem**: Takes too long to transcribe

**Solutions**:
1. Use a smaller model (`tiny` or `base`)
2. Speak shorter phrases (under 30 seconds)
3. Close other applications to free up resources
4. Consider GPU acceleration (requires NVIDIA GPU and configuration)

### Text appears in wrong place

**Problem**: Text inserts somewhere unexpected

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure the target application is focused when you release the hotkey
2. Wait for transcription to complete before clicking elsewhere
3. Some applications may not accept automated text input

### Model download is slow

**Problem**: First-time setup taking a long time

**Solutions**:
- First download can take several minutes depending on model size and internet speed
- The model is cached, so subsequent starts are much faster
- Try starting with `tiny` or `base` model for faster initial setup

## Development

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install VS Code Extensions**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions

## How It Works

1. **Startup**: Application loads your configured Whisper model on startup (may take a moment)
2. **Hotkey Detection**: Uses `pynput` to detect when your configured hotkey combination is pressed
3. **Audio Recording**: While the hotkey is held, `sounddevice` captures audio from your microphone
4. **Audio Processing**: When released, the audio is saved as a temporary WAV file (16kHz, mono)
5. **Transcription**: The Whisper model processes the audio locally
6. **Text Insertion**: Uses `pyautogui` to type the transcribed text at the current cursor position
7. **Cleanup**: Temporary audio file is deleted

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All audio processing happens on your computer
- **No Cloud**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Temporary Files**: Audio recordings are deleted immediately after transcription
- **No External Services**: Everything runs locally on your machine

## Limitations

- **Windows Only**: Application currently only supports Windows
- **Press-to-Transcribe**: No real-time streaming (must finish speaking before transcription)
- **Single Speaker**: Optimized for single-speaker dictation
- **First-Time Load**: Model download and initialization on first run can take a few minutes

## Roadmap

See [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) for detailed feature roadmap.

**Upcoming features**:
- System tray integration
- Visual recording indicator
- GPU acceleration support
- MacOS and Linux client support
- Real-time streaming transcription
